                A vegan diet is healthy overall, but avoiding animal protein can shortchange you on a few nutrients, 
                like protein, calcium, omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, vitamin B12, and vitamin D. You need protein to power 
                all the chemical reactions in your body.So, we are providing you a vegan plant based nutrients to overcome the shortchange of proteins in your body.
                The Vegan Society define veganism as â€œa way of living, which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of and cruelty to animals for food, clothing, or any other purpose. </p>
